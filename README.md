# Ramozon (CLI Storefront)

In this app, the terminal shows the client a list of items the 'Ramozon' store has for sale along with an id number and price for each product.  The client can then choose to purchase any of those products in whatever quantity of their choosing so long as there is sufficient stock available.

## What is this?
This is a node and sql app that simulates a CLI storefront somewhat similar to amazon

## What's the point?
It showcases my understanding of what's required to make sql and node work together
